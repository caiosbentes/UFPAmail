## Requirements 

For music playback to work you need the [PepperFlashPlayer plugin](https://wiki.debian.org/PepperFlashPlayer).

On Ubuntu you can install `pepperflashplugin-nonfree` (then run `sudo update-pepperflashplugin-nonfree --install`) which will copy the library to `/usr/lib/pepperflashplugin-nonfree/libpepflashplayer.so` - this path is hardcoded into the application right now. You can change it in main.js by changing the variable `pepperFlashPluginPath`.
